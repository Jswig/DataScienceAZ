*I thought it would be interesting to redo exercises from the online course Data Science AZ in R more thorouhgly*

We load the data:
``` {r}
library(ggplot2)
saldata <- read.csv('SalaryData.csv')
```

Examine descriptive statistics for data
``` {r}   
summary(saldata)
```

Fit the linear regression model and view statistics for the model
``` {r}
fm_exp <- lm(saldata$Salary ~ saldata$YearsExperience, saldata)
summary(fm_exp)
```

Plots the data and the regression line using ggplot
``` {r}
ggplot(saldata, aes(x = saldata$YearsExperience, y = saldata$Salary)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Salary by Years of Experience", x ="Years of Experience", y= "Salary ($)") + stat_smooth(method= "lm", se = FALSE) 
```
